Hi! I am **Agung**, a lecturer and researcher at the College of Vocational Studies, Universitas Negeri Surabaya (UNESA). I obtained master degree in computer science from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) in 2021.

# Research Interests

My research focuses on how **Artificial Intelligence** can transform the future of education through practical, real-world implementation. I am particularly interested in building AI-driven automated assessment systems, which I personally believe as the core foundation of modern learning, enabling scalable, objective, and personalized feedback system for students.

I also explore how VR/AR, eye-tracking, and behavioral data can shape intelligent learning environments that adapt to each learner’s needs. By integrating immersive technologies and human–computer interaction.

In addition to my work in AI and education, I also conduct research in sports technology and athlete performance analytics. UNESA has long established itself as a university with strong foundations in sports science.
