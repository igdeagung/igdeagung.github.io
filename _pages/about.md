Hi! I am **I Gde Agung Sri Sidhimantra**, a lecturer and researcher at the College of Vocational Studies, Universitas Negeri Surabaya (UNESA).  
My work focuses on advancing Artificial Intelligence in Education through the development of AI-assisted assessment systems, VR/AR learning environments, and multimodal learning analytics.

# **Research Interests**

My research focuses on how Artificial Intelligence can transform the future of education through practical, real-world implementation. I am particularly interested in building AI-driven automated assessment systems, which I view as the core foundation of modern learning, enabling scalable, objective, and personalized feedback for students.

I also explore how VR/AR, multimodal analytics, eye-tracking, and behavioral data can shape intelligent learning environments that adapt to each learner’s needs. By integrating AI with immersive technologies and human–computer interaction, my work aims to create more effective, equitable, and data-driven educational ecosystems.

In addition to my work in AI and education, I also conduct research in sports technology and athlete performance analytics. UNESA has long established itself as a university with strong foundations in education, arts, and sports science. Together, these efforts reflect my broader interest in applying AI, data science, and intelligent systems across both education and sports, two major focus areas within UNESA to improve learning, performance, and decision-making at scale.
